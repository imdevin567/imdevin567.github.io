I am proud to announce that a site I recently built with the [Anchor Marketing & Design](http://anchormd.com) team in Fort Worth has been nominated for a CSS Award! The site was built for the [Fort Worth Food + Wine Festival](http://fortworthfoodandwinefestival.com) and launched about a month ago. Hats off to the Anchor team for a job well done!

Go ahead and check out the site at <http://fortworthfoodandwinefestival.com> and don't forget to vote for us on the [CSS Awards website](http://www.cssawards.net/nominee/fort-worth-food-wine-festival/)!

___**Note: This site has since been rebuilt to incorporate more content. Horizontal scrolling websites work really great for small sites, not so great for large sites. Regardless, looked great then, looks great now!___
