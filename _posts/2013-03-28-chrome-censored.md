Scenario: You are browsing the web, perhaps reading your favorite blog. After you finish the article you scroll down the page and begin reading the comments, only to discover that two (or more) users have found themselves in a heated keyboard war against each other. More than likely, one of those users is a devoted visitor to the site, and the other is simply a troll that enjoys getting into heated keyboard wars. Regardless, the profanity would make your grandmother cringe!

**Shelby**: You're just mad because you're a $*&!@ !3&4#^*  
@ **born_this_way993**: #&$24! shelby go to %&7^ with ur !^#$ frends u %#^2&56&!

Good gosh! What ever can we do about this? Introducing,Â **Chrome Censored--**a Google Chrome extension that turns profanity into humor. Remember our little fight between Shelby and born_this_way993? Well imagine visiting that same page and viewing this instead:

**Shelby**: You're just mad because you're a dag nab kangaroo pouch  
**born_this_way993**: jinkies shelby go to houston with ur typewriter frends u exfoliating hungry hungry hippo!

Oh, the joys of the interweb. This extension works best on static sites, as it simply performs a [javascript replace method](http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_replace.asp) once the page is finished loading. I've found it doesn't work well on Facebook since most of the content there is loaded via ajax as you move around the site. I'm also sure I missed some profanity words considering the vast amount of verbiage one could use to express their vulgarity on the web. Just writing the code made me sweat a bit.

You can grab a copy of Chrome Censored in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chrome-censored/bimpoihegbhelhdhbegiifeffngnmhdl). Don't forget to rate it and leave a comment!
